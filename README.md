# Autonomous Agent Network Orchestrator (C# / Blazor / Docker)

## 🧠 Overview

This project is a **modular AI agent framework** built in **C#/.NET**, designed to orchestrate, isolate, and operate autonomous agents in **sandboxed Docker containers**.

Each agent operates independently with its own reasoning loop, memory, and tools. A central orchestrator manages their lifecycle and coordination.

The frontend is implemented in **Blazor** to provide a live dashboard, task interface, and system visibility.

---

## Getting Started

This repository now includes a .NET solution with starter projects. To build the entire solution run:

```bash
dotnet build WorldSeed.sln
```

Use `scripts/devtools.ps1` for simple dev workflows.

Both the backend (Orchestrator.API) and the Blazor UI run on the same local machine. Calls between them do not require any authentication.

### Running without Docker

If Docker is not available on your system you can still run the agents locally.
Set the environment variable `USE_LOCAL_AGENT=1` before starting the orchestrator
and it will launch agent processes directly using `dotnet run` instead of
spinning up containers. Each agent gets its own temporary workspace under
`/tmp/worldseed/<id>` which is deleted when the agent stops, so it can install
tools or run tests without affecting the host environment.

Alternatively set `USE_VM_AGENT=1` to start each agent inside a lightweight
Ubuntu virtual machine powered by **QEMU**. The orchestrator creates a temporary
VM image under `/tmp/worldseed-vm/<id>` and removes it once the agent exits.

### OpenAI Configuration

Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` before starting the orchestrator
if you want the agents to use the real OpenAI API. When this variable is not
present the runtime falls back to a mock provider that simply echoes prompts.

### Agent Loop Count

The number of iterations an agent performs can be specified by setting the
`LOOP_COUNT` environment variable or by passing a `loops` value when starting an
agent through the API. If neither is supplied, the agent defaults to **5** loops.
The agent will run until either it receives the `DONE` signal from the LLM or
the configured loop count is reached. Specify `0` or any negative value to run
indefinitely until the LLM returns `DONE`. On each iteration the agent sends its
full history to the LLM provider so actions are planned with complete context.

### Expected LLM Response Format

The planner parses only the first line of the LLM response and expects the
format `<tool> <input>` or the single word `DONE`. If the returned tool name does
not match one of the registered tools the agent falls back to the `chat` tool.
Ensure your language model is prompted to follow this format precisely. When
using other models or custom prompts, verify that the first word corresponds to
a valid tool name such as `chat`, `echo`, `list`, `compare`, or `web`.
When calling the `web` tool, place the URL in quotes, for example:
`web "https://example.com"`. Unquoted URLs like `web https://example.com` are
also accepted, but quoting ensures the parser handles spaces correctly.

When an unknown tool is encountered the agent reuses the `chat` tool to handle
the response. Such fallbacks do not count toward the configured loop limit, but
after three consecutive unknown responses the agent stops to avoid an infinite
loop.

### Keeping Containers Alive

Agents normally exit after the loop completes. The runtime now waits
indefinitely so logs continue streaming unless `KEEP_ALIVE=0` is provided. The
orchestrator explicitly sets `KEEP_ALIVE=1` when launching agents so they remain
running until stopped.

### Plugin System

The runtime automatically loads any `.dll` files under a `plugins` folder. The included **Codex.Plugin** provides a `codex` tool with Git helpers and patch generation commands such as `codex generate` and `codex autopatch`. Both commands support a `--files` option to supply additional file context when creating patches, and `autopatch` accepts `--commit <msg>` to immediately commit the result. Additional helpers like `codex build`, `codex run`, `codex test`, and `codex tools` streamline local development by compiling, testing, executing projects, or listing available tools. The `codex test` command validates code in an isolated workspace and returns `PASS` or `FAIL` so agents receive ground-truth results.
The Blazor UI exposes these capabilities through a **Codex** page where you can run commands manually without launching an agent. The page shows Codex's current status and recent log output and includes a button to clear the log history.

🧩 Components

1. Orchestrator.API

ASP.NET Core backend

Responsibilities:

Accept tasks from UI

Launch/terminate agent containers via Docker.DotNet

Expose agent status and logs over REST

Assign goals, environment variables, or task definitions



2. Orchestrator.UI (Blazor Server)

Live dashboard UI for:

Agent creation and management

Task submission

Real-time log and memory inspection

The UI now includes a **Logs** page that polls the API for messages from each
agent and displays them in real time. A new **Memory** page shows the latest
memory entries reported by each agent.



3. Agent.Runtime

C# console app compiled into a Docker image

Executes the agent reasoning loop

Communicates with orchestrator via REST

Supports goal decomposition, vector memory, and tool invocation

🔐 Isolation Model

Each agent runs in its own Docker container, with:

Memory/CPU limits (configurable)

Separate mounted volumes (/agent/memory)

Optional network isolation


Communication via:

REST back to orchestrator


---

🚀 Deployment & Execution

🔧 Prerequisites

.NET 8 SDK

Docker Desktop

Optional: Redis or message queue for shared memory


🛠️ Build All

dotnet build ./src

🐳 Build Agent Image

docker build -f ./docker/agent.Dockerfile -t worldseed-agent:latest .

Building the solution automatically removes the previous `worldseed-agent:latest` image and rebuilds it so everything stays up-to-date.

The build also compiles the Agent.Runtime project in Release mode so the Docker
context contains the latest binaries. The agent image now installs **Chromium**
and **ChromeDriver** so the Selenium-based `web` tool can fetch websites during
execution.

▶️ Run Orchestrator Locally

cd src/Orchestrator.API
dotnet run

Once running, start an agent with:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/agent/start" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"goal":"echo hello","loops":5}'
```

```bash
# list running agents
curl http://localhost:5000/api/agent/list

# stop an agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/agent/<id>/stop
```

🔄 Agent Lifecycle

1. User submits goal via UI


2. Orchestrator generates unique agent ID and assigns metadata


3. Orchestrator spins up a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d --rm \
  --name agent-{id} \
  worldseed-agent:latest --goal="..."
```


4. Agent begins loop: Thought → Tool → Action → Memory


5. Agent saves logs thar can be obtained by the REST API


6. Orchestrator tears down or persists agent state

📡 Communication Protocols

Component	Protocol	Description

UI ↔ Orchestrator	REST	Live UI sync, task submission
Orchestrator ↔ Agent	REST	Commands, status, goal injection
Agent ↔ Tools	Local call	CLI, file system, internal logic

🧠 Agent Capabilities

Each agent supports:

Goal decomposition using LLM APIs

Memory vectorization (e.g., using embeddings)

Execution of tools (e.g., web fetch, calculator, file ops)

Dynamic tool loading (via plugin system or REST)



---

🧪 Extending the System

To add a new tool:

1. Define it in Agent.Runtime/Tools/


2. Register in ToolRegistry.cs


3. Allow goal planner to discover and call it



To add a new agent profile:

Extend AgentConfig DTO

Mount custom volumes or ENV vars in orchestrator
